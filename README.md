# Broken Calc

## How to play
In this single player game, you are given **3 small** numbers and **2 big** numbers. The aim is to use the given numbers and basic **math operators** to make numbers that are as close to the **3-digit target** number as possible in **60 seconds**. You may only use each number **once**. Each number you create adds to your score based on **how far away** it is from the target number.
